## Dataset Description

The dataset *online_circular.RData* is located in the *objects* folder. It contains information about various attributes of a study involving participants, their responses, and video stimuli.

#### Loading the Dataset

To load the dataset *online_circular.RData* into R, you can use the following code:

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Load the dataset
load("online_circular.RData")
```

After executing the code, 4 the datasets will be loaded into your R environment and will be accessible for further analysis and exploration.

1. `coords`: Genova Emotion Wheel references.

2. `dataset_full`: Contains all information about various attributes of a study involving participants, their responses, and video stimuli. The dataset consists of 4,388 rows and 25 columns.

3. `dataset_gw1`: Fltered version of `dataset_full` restricted to GW1 task's trials without neutral videos. The dataset consists of 1824 rows and 25 columns.

4. `dataset_neutral`: Filtered version of `dataset_full` restricted to GW1 task's trials only with neutral videos.
